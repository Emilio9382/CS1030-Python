#Looks like this bit of code will loop itself a total of 5 times -EP
#it will start from 0 to 4 making it a total of 5 iteration 0,1,2,3,4 -EP
#and also prints that iteration -EP
#if changed from 5 to 10 it will iteration 10 times starting from 0 ending at 9 - EP
#it loops it self until it hits the number we want it to hit -EP
#if its -5 we run into an error -EP
#count would loop itself until we hit the range -EP
